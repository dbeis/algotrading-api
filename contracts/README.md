# Contracts

Versioned

## Usage

`from contracts import *`

or

`from contracts.[versionNumber] import *` to keep compatibility -- update `versionNumber` incrementally to avoid breaking code.

All the changes after publishing are made as additions. 

This package only contains plain-old python classes only used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
