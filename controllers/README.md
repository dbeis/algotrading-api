# Controllers

Each submodule corresponds to endpoint url suffixes.

## Definition
A Controller is a class that implements operations defined by an application’s API. It implements an application’s business logic and acts as a bridge between the HTTP/REST API and domain/database models. 


## Submodules

    - `crawler` -> `/api/crawler/...`
    - `data` -> `/api/data/...`
    - `ml` -> `/api/ml/...`
    and so on..

The controllers are devided into module based files.

Each file contains further details on every module's controller.
